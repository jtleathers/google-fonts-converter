# Convert Google Fonts URL to use Variable Font Files
This converter takes a normal Google Fonts URL and converts it into a Google Fonts URL that will return variable font files instead. See the HTML file for more information.

## Chat GPT Experiment
This was mostly an experiment to see how well ChatGPT could do to create the JavaScript functionality of this converter. 

It did require quite a bit of iterating through prompts and then modifying the results but the majority of the code in the JavaScript file was written by ChatGPT.

## To Do
- Add a demo showing a site calling multiple files instead of just the variable fonts (network tab in browser demos this well)
- Upload this somewhere for people to use
- Make this GitHub repo public
