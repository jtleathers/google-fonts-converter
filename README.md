# Convert Google Fonts URL to use Variable Font Files
This converter takes a normal Google Fonts URL and converts it into a Google Fonts URL that will return variable font files instead. See the HTML file for more information.

## Chat GPT Experiment
This was mostly an experiment to see how well ChatGPT could do to create the JavaScript functionality of this converter. 

It did require quite a bit of iterating through prompts and then modifying the results but the majority of the code in the JavaScript file was written by ChatGPT.

## Test it out
You can find a working version at https://jonathonleathers.com/google-fonts-converter/

## To Do
- Add a blog post about this explaining what it is, why it's helpful. Show an example site that uses non-variable font files and then show the same site using variable font files. Use the network tab in the browser to show server calls and file sizes.
